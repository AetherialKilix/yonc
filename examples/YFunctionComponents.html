    <title>YFunctionComponent example</title>
    <!-- this example shows you not only how function components reduce boilerplate, but also that you can create simple -->
    <!-- components right here in your html file without much issue -->
    <!-- note: the script type must be set to module. afaik there is a way to work around this, but i would not bother. -->
    <!-- there is no need to touch the class after it's defined, as you can simply document.createElement('my-button') -->
    <script type="module">
        // import the generator function
        import {YFunctionComponent} from "../index.mjs";
        // note how the function is the second argument for the define method?
        // that's because it actually returns a new class. not a constructor, not an object, but a whole new class
        // the YFunctionComponent function takes a render function that is simply delegated to the render function of the class
        customElements.define("example-counter", YFunctionComponent(({ $, useState }) => {
            // states work the same
            const [clicks, setClicks] = useState(0);
            // rendering works the same
            return $`<button>You clicked the button ${clicks} times</button>`;
